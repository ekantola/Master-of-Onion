MASTER OF ONION by Eemeli Kantola (e-mail: ekantola ät iki.fi)

Fairly simple 2D space shoot-'em-up multiplayer game. Has an instant laser
not found in many games, too :)

Some critical stuff is missing, as I have lost the most recent source code
due to lack of backups. If you want to play a different level, rename a file
to "mushroom.lev" or hack the source.


Compiling:

$ make

You need development files for Allegro (at least 4.0 and 4.2 work),
SDL 1.2 and XFree86 (4.x, I think). As the game was ported from DOS and
Allegro 3.x, it could work with minor or no changes with earlier versions
of the libs, too.


Running:

$ ./moon

You can configure the settings in "moon.cfg".
